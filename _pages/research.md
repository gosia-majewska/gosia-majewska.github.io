### [**Incentivizing Novelty in Antibiotic Development**](https://gosia-majewska.github.io/files/Majewska_JMP.pdf) - _Job Market Paper_

>In antibiotics, constant supply of new products is needed as bacteria become resistant to the existing drugs. At the same time, these products need to be reserved as the last line of treatment, substantially reducing their market size and disincentivizing the industry from investing in innovation in this area. In response, two incentive types have been introduced since 2012: research subsidies, and an extension of the market exclusivity period. I estimate the effect of the incentives on clinical trial success in reduced form, finding positive effects of both incentives, but not for novel projects. A dynamic structural model of pharmaceutical innovation allows me to simulate the long-term effect of the incentives on market entries and suggests a lower bound estimate of 20% increase in market entries over a 20 year period, driven mostly by push incentives.

### [**Mergers and Advertising in the Pharmaceutical Industry**](https://gosia-majewska.github.io/files/merger_advertising_Nov2022.pdf) (with [Pierre Dubois](https://pierredubois.github.io/))

>In many industries, market structure determines how firms not only compete in terms of prices but also utilize promotional activities. We study how price and advertising strategies change when firms merge in pharmaceutical markets in the US. We show that across all drug markets, although mergers indeed increase prices, advertising spending also decreases. Merger simulations not accounting for advertising reductions may thus obtain biased price effects. Considering the merger effects of two large pharmaceutical companies on an antimicrobial drug market, we estimate a structural model of supply and demand and simulate the merger effect. We find that the merger effect on prices is smaller given the reduction in the amount of advertising. We also provide a simple method through which to evaluate long-term welfare effects using some known value of the sensitivity of innovation to profits.
